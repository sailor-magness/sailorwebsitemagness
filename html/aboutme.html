<h2 id="Lorem_Ipsum">The Colosseum Over the Centuries</h2>
    <p class="main-content">
        The Colosseum saw some four centuries of active use, until the struggles of the Western Roman Empire and the gradual change in public tastes put an end to gladiatorial combats and other large public entertainments by the 6th century A.D. Even by that time, the arena had suffered damaged due to natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes. In the centuries to come, the Colosseum was abandoned completely, and used as a quarry for numerous building projects, including the cathedrals of St. Peter and St. John Lateran, the Palazzo Venezia and defense fortifications along the Tiber River. Beginning in the 18th century, however, various popes sought to conserve the arena as a sacred Christian site, though it is in fact uncertain whether early Christian martyrs met their fate in the Colosseum, as has been speculated.

        By the 20th century, a combination of weather, natural disasters, neglect and vandalism had destroyed nearly two-thirds of the original Colosseum, including all of the arena’s marble seats and its decorative elements. Restoration efforts began in the 1990s, and have proceeded over the years, as the Colosseum continues to be a leading attraction for tourists from all over the world.

 <h2 id="Lorem_Ipsum1">LDS Rome Temple Being Built</h2>
    <p class="main-content">
        For members in Italy, October 4, 2008, was something akin to winning the World Cup with a last-minute goal. On that day, President Thomas S. Monson announced that a temple would finally be built in Rome. In true Italian fashion, members expressed their happiness with passion: “There was a big shout from all the people,” says Sami Cantafio, a convert from Rome. “It was thrilling.”

Miracle after miracle led to this historic milestone as the Church overcame obstacles to build a temple in Rome. For example, in Italy, legal guidelines require a property to be examined for ancient ruins before any new construction is permitted. Fearing that an archeological discovery would postpone temple construction, Church members in Rome held a special fast on the day the property was inspected. Although a small well was found in the corner of the land, it was deemed to be not significant enough to impede construction. Considering that an old Roman village was discovered just 100 yards beyond the property line, the fact that no other archeological findings were located was miraculous.

Located in the visitors’ center of the new temple are replicas of Bertel Thorvaldsen’s statues Christus and the Twelve Apostles. Although Thorvaldsen was a Danish sculptor of international fame, he spent most of his life in Italy. He created the original masterpieces in his own workshop in Rome. The source of marble for each replica statue was the Cave Michelangelo. This was the same quarry in Carrara, Italy, where Thorvaldsen found marble for his original sculptures, and using it paid homage to the importance of both Christianity and creativity in Italy. Also in the visitors’ center is a stunning five-panel stained glass mural portraying every parable the Savior taught.
